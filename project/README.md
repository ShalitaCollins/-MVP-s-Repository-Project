Projectâ€™s Name: CommuniConnect

INTRODUCTION

CommuniConnect was created to make staying in touch with friends and family easier. I found it hard to use different apps for video calls, messages, and connecting with family members who aren't good with technology. This made communication harder than it should be. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I saw that many apps weren't easy or reliable enough for everyone to use. This made me want to create a better, all-in-one communication tool.
